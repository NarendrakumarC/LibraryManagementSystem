# LibraryManagementSystem
Library Management Class Design

Build a library system where:
The library can have Books, magazines and Journals.
Some types of items can be loaned and some are only for reading at library. 
Users (Members : Students, Professors) can borrow and return different types of Library items.
Books have categories (Fiction, Non-fiction, Academic).
A loan management system keeps track of issued books.
Implement features like late fees and borrowing limits.
